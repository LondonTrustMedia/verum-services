/*
Package s2s provides IRC Server-to-Server protocol modules.

This allows you to have a single simplified interface that can be used to
interact with a number of different IRC servers. The upside of this is that
you can implement code once and have it work across a number of different
servers.

The main intent with this package is to develop InspIRCd support first, and to
make it easy to implement support for other IRCds later down the track.
