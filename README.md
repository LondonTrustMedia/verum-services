# Veritas

Veritas is the primary IRC services package for Verum. It provides nickname and channel registration capabilities, as well as extensive identity verification methods.

Veritas is designed for use with InspIRCd. However, attempts have been made to use a relatively generic interface so that support for other daemons can be added.


## (Planned) Features

* Extensive identity management and verification.
* Chanmode/extban to restrict talking to verified individuals (GPG/Bitcoin verification).
* Account and channel registration.
* SASL authentication.
* Management of accounts and channels.
* Salted and hashed password storage.
* DEFCON system, similar to other major services platforms.
* A focus on developing with specifications and enabling modern features.
* [YAML](http://yaml.org/) configuration.
